# The Captchacker Project: Captcha Breaking using Support Vector Machines #

## Abstract ##
_The Captchacker Project exploits the potential of
Support Vector Machines to break visual captchas. We
define “simulation-based” and “captcha-based” methods
to build our models._


_Our method performs extremely well for breaking
easily-segmentable captchas, with a robust recognition.
We also give a generalization to non easily segmentable –
thus harder to break – captchas, using Dynamic
Programming. Besides, we explain how to get a large
training set without going through the long and boring
task of manual labelling._


_Finally, our source code is available here._
